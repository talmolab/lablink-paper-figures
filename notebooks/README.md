# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and figure generation.

## Organization

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Initial data exploration and quality checks
- `02_figure_*.ipynb` - Individual notebooks for each figure in the paper
- `supplementary_*.ipynb` - Notebooks for supplementary figures

## Usage

Start Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or use JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks focused on a single analysis or figure
- Use markdown cells to document your analysis
- Clear all outputs before committing (except for final figure notebooks)
- Import reusable code from the `src/` directory
